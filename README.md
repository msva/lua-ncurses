# WARNING

The project has been abandoned, since I have no time to rewrite it to be
Lua52-Lua53 compatible, while LuaPosix project does all the same things
(and has support for lot more ncurses A{B,P}I.

Anyway, if you want to take care on the project, you're free to contact me by
email from github profile and ask to reroot repo, then you'll be free to do
`git reset --hard @~1 && git push -f`, so repo will be resurrected on latest
state (before I started my try to port it to modern API and decided to abandon).
